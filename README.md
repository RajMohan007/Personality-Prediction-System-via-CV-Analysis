# Personality-Prediction-System-via-CV-Analysis
In this script:

*We define a sample CV text as a string (you should replace it with actual CV text).

*We create a dictionary of personality trait keywords associated with certain personality traits.

*We initialize a dictionary to store scores for each personality trait.

*We tokenize the CV text into words using regular expressions.

*We check for the presence of trait keywords in the CV text and increment the score for each trait accordingly.

*We determine the personality trait with the highest score as the predicted trait.

Please note that this script is a very simplistic approach to predicting personality traits and is highly speculative. The accuracy of such predictions would be limited, and a more robust approach would require natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a larger and more diverse dataset for training and validation. Additionally, personality traits are typically assessed through psychological assessments and interviews rather than CV analysis.
